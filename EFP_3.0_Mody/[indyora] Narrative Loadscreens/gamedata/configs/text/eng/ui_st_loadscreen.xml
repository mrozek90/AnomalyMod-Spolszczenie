		<text>Escape From Pripyat</text>
	</string>

	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_1">
		<text>"Is it true?" "Yes. There was some sort of critical failure, and radiation has spread all around. Pripyat is being evacuated. Keep this between ourselves." The Director hung up the phone and leaned back in his chair, deep in thought. Perhaps this was just the opportunity his project needed. He picked up the phone and began to dial.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_2">
		<text>It didn't go to plan. I was on the ground clutching my abdomen and cursing the little lead slug that was twisting around in there. Even in my agony, I grimaced at the irony. "They had a sniper in that tower. Those crafty bastards." I heard footsteps and looked up to find a gun barrel and a gas mask with a pair of soulless eyes behind them. Then a bang.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_3">
		<text>Now that I was safe, I decided to take a breather and check the goods in my pack: three Flashes, a Fireball, some sort of greenish Shell, thirteen anomalous strands, and a clay sphere that could levitate. I smiled to myself and zipped up the pack - first good day in months!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_4">
		<text>That seedy bastard was grinning at me across the table - he knew that I had already given in. "You'd better come through for me, I want a ticket out of here and no tricks." He reassured me and passed me another glass. So I told him everything. Come morning, the entire garrison was killed, to the very last man.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_5">
		<text>It wasn't long before we got held up by bandits. I had heard of these ones before, and I had a bad feeling - these rapists and murderers wouldn't be content with just our stuff. As I was trying to come up with a plan, the stalker next to me drew a gun and killed them before they could react. He faded into the night, leaving us standing there in silence.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_6">
		<text>"Results?" "We have a co-efficient of forty seven point... five, Professor." The Professor smiled and removed his hearing protection, gazing upon the giant machine and the smoking hole with admiration. Finally stabilized... I'd like to see armor plating that can withstand this! The assistant went up to the control panel, and the electric hum gradually died away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_7">
		<text>The sortie was careful to stay well enough away from the marked regions inside of the fenced area. There were three choppers and all were making use of night-vision optics. "Movement! Towards the border from bearing 275!" The gunner swiveled over and saw the target - some sort of bizarre animal pack. The gun pods opened fire.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_8">
		<text>"Finally, to give over my physical body to the Zone in battle and to let my consciousness dissolve within." The only light in the cave was a reddish fire. "Good", said the one they called Chernobog. "Now, for the last rite." The initiate was grabbed from behind by four strong arms, and a needle was inserted into his neck. As his senses dulled, a cloudy veil passed over him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_9">
		<text>I had lain this way for hours, but my crosshair never moved from his head. "C'mon, why wait?", I thought impatiently. I didn't have much reason to complain - this job couldn't be easier, just had to wait for the confirmation. The target looked around then pulled out the small encoder I had been waiting for. After a moment of sympathy, I squeezed the trigger.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_10">
		<text>The exit was just ahead. Dragging my bleeding leg through the tunnel passage, I listened for the sounds that I dreaded coming up from behind. On the upside, I had the object clutched safely in my arm. As I turned the last corner, my heart sank. The door was completely blocked - a cave-in. Throwing my treasure to the floor, I sank to my knees and accepted my fate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_11">
		<text>The novice watched his mentor crouch down, all the way to the ground, to slide under the pulsating spot above. It had been fifteen minutes since he had entered, but he was almost near the end. After a couple of tentative bolt throws, he slowly reached out his hand towards the glowing shape. He grasped it and placed it into the jar. The novice grinned with admiration.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_12">
		<text>Another dreary day at the border posting. Oranovsky noticed that many more seemed to be leaving than entering, in contrast to the past few busy weeks of new operations. He asked a passing corporal, who simply said, "We have angered the Zone. There's nothing but failure for us there." Gloomily, he trudged past.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_13">
		<text>It was a beautiful morning in Sochi, but the grimy windows of the trashy bar blocked it out. The two men had just stopped talking and were waiting for the third to answer. Gritsenko slowly said, after a long drag on his cigarette, "Very well, I'll take a look at your little circus. I want half of the money now as well as a full set-up on site." The three proposed a toast.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_14">
		<text>The view from the top of the tower was almost pretty, as long as you forgot where you were. The scout took another look at the eastern treeline and stopped short of some shadows just shy of the clearing. Something emerged onto the plain and into the view of his binoculars. He hurriedly whispered into the radio, "It's starting, looks like more than we thought."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_15">
		<text>"And you", said Sultan, "thought no one would notice?" The prisoner was silent, which only inflamed Sultan's temper. He signaled to the man with the steel bar, and the beating began. Periodically, he would stop to let the captive talk, but he never did. Soon, Sultan forgot his anger and was impressed. Maybe this man was better a servant than an enemy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_16">
		<text>There were three of them crawling through the field: Anton, Kostya, and the guide. Darkness had fallen a half hour ago, and they had just crawled underneath the hole in the fence. Still, it was a hundred meters or more to the safety of the treeline. Suddenly, a flare bathed the land in red. "Just run, go!", shouted the guide as they sprang to their feet.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_17">
		<text>I didn't want to think about the water I was immersed in - honestly, I'd be happy enough to live through the next 24 hours, screw the cancer. My mask was water-tight, so I was able to look up from the bottom of the pool towards the surface where my drinking straw pulled air. I tensed as a shadow passed by - they were still searching for me.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_18">
		<text>Garik allowed himself a yawn, but he never quite took his eyes off of the strange stalker standing at the table in the corner. Barkeep was still making inquisitive faces at his bouncer, but neither of them could figure out the silent customer. Suddenly, the stalker started making towards the door, but he collapsed after a step. He was in a coma, and the doc was stumped.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_19">
		<text>The mercenary woke up in the darkness with a cry, looking for his gun. Then, as he saw his surroundings, he remembered where he was, even though that wasn't much comfort. "Get a fucking grip", he muttered. He had the nightmare again - it followed him even here. Taking an empty bottle of whiskey, he flung it across the room where it shattered.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_20">
		<text>The blazing campfire shot up defiantly into the black night sky, and the three wayfarers were all glad for its comfort. They didn't have any more stories to tell, and the guitar was busted, so they just sat there, vaguely listening. They felt a sense of danger, but removed danger, like gunshots over the horizon. One by one, they drifted off to sleep.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_21">
		<text>The sun was rising on Rostok as the private waited around for his watch to be relieved. The sun mounted the grey concrete and rusty towers of the old plant and, to his surprise, the private found his eyes full of tears. When was the last time he had seen such a sunrise? It must have been all those years ago, back when life seemed much more small and good. He bowed his head.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_22">
		<text>With a scraping noise, the massive door swung open on its rusty hinges; it had been decades since this door was opened. The half-dozen Spetsnaz operators trained their weapons on the utterly black passageway that had just been revealed and waited for orders. After a pause, a feral bellow issued from somewhere deep inside the installation.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_23">
		<text>"There have been many rumors going around, but I would like to reiterate that they are only just rumors." The Minister of the Interior was speaking to a throng of jostling reporters; one of them asked: "So the reports of military action within the Exclusion Zone are false?" "They are completely out of proportion, there only exists a minor policing dispatch."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_24">
		<text>After several minutes, the old man sitting on the stool began to speak, "Expect a series of harsh emissions in two days. I also see a push by the Monolith - they will redouble their attack on Limansk." The prophet fell silent - there would be no more news. The visitors exchanged significant looks and prepared to leave - the old man's predictions had yet to fail.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_25">
		<text>As the young man prepared to leave the room, Forester suddenly grabbed his arm and gripped. "Wait", he hissed. The young stalker stopped breathing as a distortion of pain and fear appeared on the old ranger's face. After three tense minutes, the ranger relaxed and withdrew his arm. "Go now, my son. The danger has passed."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_26">
		<text>"Now, you just go to bed and no more jumping about." Mr. Howell left his daughter's room and stopped in his tracks by the window; his jaw dropped. From the window of his flat, over the lights of London, a dazzling glow lit up the eastern sky. He exhaled - not a nuke, he thought. He didn't want Jordan to see this. He dialed 999, but all lines were busy. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_27">
		<text>I held up both hands, although it was difficult from my position on the ground. The group of men surrounded me, most of them were pointing guns. I had ditched my shooter and my insignia, but it was still obvious who I was. As I awaited judgment I heard, "Wait!". An older stalker pushed into the circle and held out his hand to me. "I'm Fanatic."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_28">
		<text>After I tied my shoes I did one last check: coat, food, some money, a pair of felt boots, and the old hunting rifle. As I stepped out the door, thin arms clasped me from behind. "Please don't, you won't come back." I turned around and gathered Katya's hands within mine. "I will. And everything will be better." That's the last thing I ever said to her.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_29">
		<text>Ivar was called "The Tractor" because he was big, strong, and not very subtle. He walked right up to the lounging, hooded stalker in the Bar and gave him a neat one in the face. Out of respect to the proprietor, he dragged the skinny man out of the Bar and flung him to the ground. "It was you!", he growled. Time to get answers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_30">
		<text>I adjusted the oxygen tank on my back and looked up at the huge column of radioactive smoke pouring out of the reactor. Suddenly, my rubberized suit and stifling mask didn't seem heavy enough. I trudged on as a firetruck raced past, and I watched a dust cloud rise into the air. I hadn't even heard of a Sievert at that time.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_31">
		<text>This was taking way too long. The only light in the room was dirty and fluorescent, blinking upon the floor, which didn't make it any easier to find the document I was seeking. I had just gone through the second file cabinet - no luck. As I moved onto the third, I heard scuffling in the hall outside. In a panic, I ran over to the door and blocked it with a desk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_32">
		<text>On top of the grainy feed of the night vision, the pouring rain reduced visibility down to almost none. The storm seemed to be intensifying, and we were still out in the middle of wind-swept nowhere in the black of night. I turned back to Roman, but he was nowhere to be seen. Hiding wasn't an option - it was run or die.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_33">
		<text>I would go down to Sidorovich's bunker soon, but for the moment I just felt like standing in the middle of the lane, looking up at the deep night sky, resplendent with stars. My second night in the Zone! I realized that Glasgow had never seemed so far away until this very moment. I half-wondered if I would ever see it again... but it was time to get my payment.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_34">
		<text>The set day had come, and the carefully selected company issued from the military camp. Captain Tachenko led his squad out into the unmapped territory - he himself knew it well - and smashed their communications gear. They would be written off as lost. Tachenko looked at Kosmach, and they understood one another. It was time to fight the Zone on their own terms.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_35">
		<text>Another late night at the depot, and Bondarov was getting altogether fed-up with the endless paperwork blurring in front of his eyes. "What I can't understand", he said to Nikolai, "is the massive rate of equipment attrition in this sector. Why in the hell do they need two massive shipments a month?" He sighed and looked up at the logistics map: SECTOR 17, CHERNOBYL.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_36">
		<text>This was the one risky job that the smuggler accepted - it was just too good to pass up. He was piloting a little barge in the dead of night over the dark water and saw the lighted pier ahead. He knew it would be over for him if he were caught, but there was no higher-paying gun-running in the world - he didn't even have to meet with them! The sign said: "Pripyat River Port".</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_37">
		<text>After the lights were turned on, the squad commander radioed back over the encrypted channel, "This is Thrush's group in section 7, sub-level 5. We've found another supply room with a large amount of munitions and various equipment. All local resistance has been neutralized. Glory to the Monolith!"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_38">
		<text>The sweat was running down my face, and I could hardly stand; the assault on the Barrier had kept up for more than an hour. First, we were surprised by a stampede of pissed-off hogs and then a general release of all of the Zone's genetic refuse. After, when we were catching our breath, They came. By now, there were only few of us left with little hope of any reinforcements. Where has Gatekeeper gone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_39">
		<text>The truck with only one working headlight rolled up to the decrepit, but not deserted, station and stopped. A stream of men issued from the doorway, and they were all carrying bodies; they didn't bother to check which ones were still useful and which were completely dead, they just piled them in. The driver, with glazed eyes, drove off.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_40">
		<text>Once you get past the scaly hide, it's much easier. After rolling the massive corpse over with my boot, I made a few deep incisions and started pulling out the cuts that looked safe to eat. Even after avoiding the tumors, most of the meat was unpleasant. Well, fine. I had business up here, and the road to the Skadovsk was none too friendly these days.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_41">
		<text>The sirens had stopped, and that was a bad sign. The sky was erupting with orange and purple lightning. The bunker was only a dozen steps away, but Ilya's dead-weight on my wounded shoulder was crushing, and my feet stumbled. As the pulsating wave swept over from the horizon, I dumped him inside the bunker and shut the door. I mumbled a little prayer of gratitude and passed out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_42">
		<text>The junior assistant tumbled down the stairs and burst into the head office. "Comrade Professor! They're ordering a complete evacuation, apparently a reactor failure." The man sitting behind the desk coldly considered the situation and then replied, "Continue the work, comrade. We are not abandoning this facility. Send in the security chief." The assistant sprinted from the room.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_43">
		<text>After a long minute of staring at the bizarre object, Grant asked the man, "What is it?" "That's not my business.", he answered gruffly. "You wanted your expensive specimen now here it is. Where's the money?" Grant pointed him to the next room and then closed the door to the lab. Looking back to the rare object, he realized he had no idea where to begin.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_44">
		<text>The blindfolded man was shoved into the dark room, and the door slammed behind him. The sedation was wearing off, and the man felt fear. Even before he ripped his blindfold away, he knew there was something else in the room with him. A white-hot spike plunged into his brain, and he knew no more. "XI-53 terminated subject 451J within seconds. High aggression and potent telekinetics observed."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_45">
		<text>"So he's a problem?" Sidorovich wanted this matter decided on, he had other things to do. "Yes", said the northerner, "we're almost positive that he's working for the SSU." Sidorovich paused a few seconds for effect and said, "Well, we can't be too careful. You can get rid of him." Little did they know, the Major had just been extracted via helicopter the previous day.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_46">
		<text>Navigator was angry and, probably, a bit frightened. He hurled his pack to the floor and said, "We have to make up the time tomorrow, or else we're done for." He settled down to sleep as I looked around the place. There would be no fire - too dangerous. I heard the howling from the far moon-lit plains. It would be a long night.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_47">
		<text>More ground units, more air patrols, and even a BTR that they managed to drag across the swamps - not good. I'm the only one in the entire sector, so I have to transmit the co-ordinates extremely cautiously. Suddenly, a soldier walks up to my hiding place - I could almost touch his boot. Then he moves on. How long until Lebedev can send relief? I'm nearly out of water...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_48">
		<text>Podychev was having severe second doubts when he saw his stasis chamber, and he froze in place. After a while, Professor Chubko came in and assured him, "We talked about this, remember? There will be no pain, and after, there will be nothing that can harm you." Chubko guided him by the hand, but he was still terrified. He lowered himself into the tube and was sealed in.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_49">
		<text>I looked down at the fallen Duty man. His breathing was shallow and fitful, and his armor was rent and studded with impact marks. "Well?", said Messer, "Do we finish him?" I took a medpack and some water out of my bag and laid them at his side. Then I gave the signal to move on. Messer ran up to my side. "Lukash will be pissed if he hears." I didn't care, I had enough killing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_50">
		<text>I sat at the desk, and Kuznetsov stood over me. "Sign it.", he commanded. I looked down at the report - a lie. But we both knew I didn't have much of a choice. As I started writing I could feel him lean back and resume his informal air. "CASUALTY CERTIFICATE: Major Khaletskiy - MIA, unknown fate"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_51">
		<text>The cables detached, and the massive helicopters flew off, glad to be rid of their burden. The concrete research bunker squatted heavily in its new position; there was much work to be done, but the surrounding area had to first be secured. The military security team had been there for days, but hostile activity from the swamp started up again as soon as the lab was dropped.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_52">
		<text>Kalancha held his breath as the program opened up and the radio signals came in. It worked! Here, upon the computer monitor, was an entire sensor array feeding in various measurements from the whole swamp. Kalancha could now monitor both anomaly changes and physical movement, be it human or otherwise. The smiling technicians came in - time for a toast!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_53">
		<text>I crawled up onto the back of the thing and tried to hold it down, but even with a shattered arm it was immensely strong. Its muscular legs were battering away as I attempted to get my hands around its neck. Before it got loose, I grabbed the gas mask stuck on its face and pulled, and it emitted a horrible screech of pain and anger. I finally got to my knife and stuck it in the neck.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_54">
		<text>As the dark shape approached him, Taras strained with all his being to match the mental power that was exerting itself upon him. He had been preparing for this moment, the trial in which he would defeat the genetic monstrosity at its own game - but now he was faltering. Disjointed, nightmarish images flashed into his head as his concentration weakened. His last thought: "I failed."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_55">
		<text>He rifled through the pockets of the backpack: loose ammo, a Geiger counter, some hand-written notes now blurred by the blood... a fancy scientific container, probably with some artefact in it. "Thanks for the tip, buddy!", the looter said, gloating over the dead man. Little did he know that the team hunting that prize was now after him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_56">
		<text>After a long time waiting, I took my hand from the grenade and placed it beside me. The battle was over, and they obviously weren't going to find me. The blast blew me into this little room and cracked my head against the wall. Now... I felt strange. I felt my cloudy surety fade and a disturbing idea take its place. Why was I trying to kill those people? Has the Monolith left me?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_57">
		<text>I paced outside the door, wracked with indecision. It was a close shave, and I was lucky to be alive. I should be running for the hills, but... Bursts of automatic fire and reverberating roars resounded from the warehouse. "Dammit! He's going to owe me for this." I put in a fresh mag and charged back in.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_58">
		<text>The alpha boar crashed into the clearing, whipping around and looking for a safe passage. Behind it, the automatic fire of the beaters was getting closer, and the alpha made for a sloping glen, with his pack in tow. They made it halfway before a heavy MG opened up, ripping through the first line of the muscled beasts. By the time the beaters caught up, it was all over. Another victory for Duty.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_59">
		<text>Ozersky stared at the numbers on the screen until they were burned into his retina. It was a moment of profound despair for him. "We can't even describe what it is that we don't understand". If the Zone had previously thrown off all attempts at categorization, then this test proved that they couldn't even rule anything out. Ozersky got over it - they would try again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_60">
		<text>The only thing that was apparent to Pavlik was that his head really, really hurt, as well as the vague notion that he had to remember something important. He sat, with others like him, around a cold firepit in the pouring rain, and none of them knew why. Fleeting images of his past life sometimes appeared in Pavlik's head, but he didn't understand them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_61">
		<text>It was difficult living a double life, and Owl was now trying to cope with some sort of triple life. He still sent tips to his old friends in Yanov and even in Dark Valley, but he had to keep that awfully quiet these days. He didn't mind his public persona - he had developed real camaraderie with some of Beard’s stalkers. But then there was his very secret life: sending cryptic data to the SSU.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_62">
		<text>I looked down at the body, and it was obvious he wasn't going to make it. He had lost too much blood and, even without that, the infection had spread down through the whole leg. The terrible thing was that I would have procured his death even if he had a chance; I hated myself for it, but it had been too long since my last taste, and my hands were shaking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_63">
		<text>With the coming of dawn, I looked out over the fen and saw him, just a little black spot in the distance. It looks like I had neither closed the distance nor lengthened it; at least the anomalies prevented him from moving at night. I shouldered my bag and started at a brisk pace; no matter how far he went, I would catch him, and I would take back what is mine.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_64">
		<text>As the captain took the guitar in his hands, the rest of the group around the fire went silent - everyone already had great respect for the captain, but they also had a sort of veneration for his music. After a moment of thought, the captain strummed beautiful, simple notes and took up a strange song in a low voice full of sorrow. They didn't even notice dawn approaching.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_65">
		<text>Novikov took the rifle in hand and gave his visitor a look full of good-natured exasperation. "How did you even manage to twist the gas piston?" The other shrugged and said something about Chemic's home-made high-velocity ammunition. Novikov gave him a little chuckle and sent him out the door. "Ahh, yes. Here we have the finest minds the Zone has to offer..."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_66">
		<text>It had been a half-hour since they had seen the strange animal, and the tourists were still excitedly discussing it. Suddenly, soldiers appeared in front of the bus, and it screeched to a halt. Dozens of guns were trained on the windows, and orders were shouted, but most passengers knew no Russian or Ukrainian. As they filed out, the Colonel radioed, "They've seen too much..."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_67">
		<text>The father and his son were attempting to make their way to the top of the hill, but the driving wind threatened to carry them away. They finally crested the summit and, over the flapping of their coats, the boy shouted, "Papa, what is that?" No need to point, they were both staring at the cyclone of circling winds over the far-off power plant. The father had no answer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_68">
		<text>This had gone on for nearly an hour, and my nerves were at a breaking point. I stood in the middle of the bedroom and listened, straining to hear any movement in the dark house. I knew something was down there, and I had a nasty feeling it knew I was here as well. Why didn't it come up the stairs? I couldn't take it anymore. Breaking the silence, I kicked open the balcony door and jumped.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_69">
		<text>Sakharov's frosty impatience wore thin, and he cut the stalker short, "Young man, I do not know what you take me for, but I am not some senile old man, too gullible to know when he's being lied to. Either pay the agreed price or leave my facility." Black moved up behind the stalker and leered at him threateningly. "Good!”, Sakharov thought, "So that's what I'm paying him for!"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_70">
		<text>The scientist and his four protectors were standing in the middle of the circle of bonfires, each pointing a weapon out into the inky blackness. The last time they had come, those things carried away the other scientist, and the group could feel their presence just outside the ring of light. Each of them was hoping against hope for the rise of the sun, but they all knew it was hours away.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_71">
		<text>I never thought I would wake up again, but that didn't make crawling out of a pile of corpses more enjoyable. I desperately tried to remember what happened and where I might be now, but it was all jumbled up. However, I did know who brought me here, so I pulled a Beretta off of a corpse and checked the magazine. With fear in my heart, I left the concrete chamber.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_72">
		<text>The two heavily armed men left the passageway. As I peered out from my hiding place, I tried to figure out the quickest way outside before they came back. I picked a door and cautiously pushed it open, the pistol in my other hand. I had planned to use it on myself... to not let them get me... but I was unsure. I turned the corner right into the face of a Monolith soldier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_73">
		<text>Although I was considering using it on myself, my instincts decided for me - I pointed the pistol at the fanatic and fired away. In a moment, I was running through the subterranean halls, looking for an escape. I raced up a long flight of stairs and pushed open the steel door. Ahead, something like moonlight was shining through a window. Have I made it? I ran.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_74">
		<text>The fresh night air had never tasted so sweet, but I had little time to savor it. By now, they would know that someone had escaped, and they would all be searching with one mind. For the first time, I observed my surroundings and realized I was in the middle of Pripyat. Chances seemed slim, but I ran for the nearest building, hiding in the dark from the white glow of the moon.</text>

		<text>After the air-lock door had sealed, Professor Hermann hissed through his teeth. The interview had been frightening, not to mention humiliating. How could things get to this point? He thought of his prestige and the respect that he commanded in the outside world, the awards his research had garnered. Now he was being bullied by some gun wielding thug for protection money? He spat.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_76">
		<text>"Alright, so we can count you in tomorrow? We're going up to the old office building to look for artefacts." I told them yes. Later, I recited, "Five men, lightly armed and not expecting any fighting. They're searching for artefacts." Stribog clasped my shoulder. "You have done well, my son. We need this." We tried to take as many of them alive as we could.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_77">
		<text>It was crippled, but it was still alive. It looked up at me with fiery hate in its eyes and roared. Even in this situation, I was petrified. After a brief moment which felt to me an eternity, I raised my shotgun and blew its head clean off. Gonta walked up to my side and nodded in approval. "Well done - your first. That's one less bloodsucker to haunt the swamps."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_78">
		<text>"Just fucking go!" Stunned by the display of levitating objects in the first room, Rhino's words brought us to our senses. "Check your corners, keep moving!" We navigated the rooms in a near-panic, feeling the awful presence of something close; no amount of pay justified this. As we rushed through another lab, a growl came from a dark corner. "Kill it, quick!" We emptied our mags into the darkness.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_79">
		<text>Smoke was flowing from the barrel of Zvyagintsev's rifle, but he kept up the volume of fire. Duty didn't have any squads to send, but the Major had volunteered to go alone. Mag after mag went into the Kalashnikov; it was so hot that rounds would occasionally cook off by themselves. By the time the barrel was warped, his foes were in retreat, believing they had run into a heavy-weapons squad.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_80">
		<text>The archpriest frowned his well-worn face - he had only heard vague mutterings about the dangers of this area, but they were alarming enough. The young priest with the bright eyes had heard them too, but they had only stoked his enthusiasm. "Are we not meant to go where we are needed? There are men there who need the sacraments." The archpriest sighed - he knew he was right. "Go with God."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_81">
		<text>The gathering would have turned into a lynch-mob if there was more courage to go around. After much hesitation, a bold and experienced man stepped forward and spoke for the crowd, "We want you out of here, now. Otherwise we will make you leave." The blank-faced man thought for a moment; maybe it was time to ply his trade elsewhere. As he rose to his feet, the crowd of men seemed to shrink back.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_82">
		<text>My search was over. I sunk down to the body, speechless. After they had shot him, they had stripped him too, and they dumped out the things they didn’t want to loot from his bag. Then they had left him here, like waste - trash on the side of the road. I wanted to shout, to curse them, but I just couldn't. I took refuge in the silence before I left to make my report.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_83">
		<text>"So what's wrong with him?" "He thinks he's dead. That's all he talks about. We can't find anything seriously wrong with him - it's most likely emotional trauma." "Is this the guy we found in the mutant lair?" "Yeah. He had lain there all night at least, with those freaks gathered around him. No idea why they left him alive - maybe they thought he was dead too."</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_84">
		<text>Four meters forward to pass the first anomaly on the right, then a sharp right turn, and then you have to crawl. I had been following Pilot's instructions to the letter, but I was incredibly nervous - I could never tell how far was too far. And that's how I made my mistake. One too many a step, and I heard a whirring in my ear. Very much against my will, I was lifted up into the air.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_85">
		<text>"Sometimes", Jack said, closing his eyes, "it feels like you're being dishonest with me." Another pistol-whip added a red mark to the unfortunate man's face. "I think you need to do something to change that... or you'll find it hard to talk to anyone at all." They threw the man outside, to lay there for hours.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_86">
		<text>So the jerk comes walking in, all smiles and swagger. He strides right up to me and starts telling me about his lucky find. And I smile back - just friendly old Beard. Then Grouse comes up behind him and I change my tone. "You fell for it, shitbag. We planted that artefact to find out who's been stealing. And now here we are. So, you've got till dusk to leave Zaton, or we're going to ruin that smile of yours."</text>

		<text>I had lost my PDA, my shooter, my friends, and my sense of direction. Here I was in the dark of night, rain pouring down and not a clue. I'm doing all that I can to restrain the urge to lose myself in complete panic, but it's not going well. That's when I see the familiar glow in the distance. Rostok! Oh, thank God! I don't stop running until I collapse in front of the guards.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_88">
		<text>Max shot me a wink when he handed me the crumpled envelope. "Here you go, you soft bastard." My heart beats quickly as I draw my knife to unseal it; it's a miracle that the letter even found me. I open it and read the cherished and familiar handwriting. Then I just sit there for a while, the paper pushed against my face. It even smells a bit like home.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_89">
		<text>The indicators and alarms were firing off in quick succession, making it difficult to concentrate. We were going down, but we didn't even know if we'd been hit. I scrambled to find a place to land the massive MI-6. As we touch down in the grassy clearing of a forest, I hear my co-pilot say, "I think we just landed in the God-damned Exclusion Zone!"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_90">
		<text>For a moment, nothing happened. Then the sound of an explosion ripped through the air. The raiders sprang up, advancing quickly with weapons pointed at the BTR. The vehicle was immobilized, its smoke swirling up into the evening sky. A hatch opened, and one of the crew fell limply to the ground. With dimmed eyes he could only see the boots of about a half-dozen men standing over him.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_91">
		<text>I had managed to light a small flame. Some sort of electrical anomaly must have fried my torch... I didn't care to investigate. The flickering illumination reached out to the walls, where well-worn signs seemed to me like the desperate scrawlings of the damned. It was my third day underground. There was no way out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_92">
		<text>My entire body was rigid as I sat staring into that inky darkness. One hand was on my pistol, the other held an inactive flashlight, and both were drenched in sweat. I had thought the room was safe. It was only after something had brushed my foot that I had woken up. So here I was - listening to the shrouded danger moving around the room, not daring to turn on a light.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_93">
		<text>Sepp was in great form that night; he told the one about the German stalker's girlfriend which, I gathered from the volume of laughter, they hadn't heard before. We broke out the beer we had been saving, and everyone contributed something for a feast - a feast in the heart of the Zone! That was a good time. Where are they all now, I wonder?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_94">
		<text>Yar would fall into fits of melancholy sometimes, but he hid them well enough to not raise concern from his fellow Freedomers. Sometimes, images from his long life would plant themselves in his mind, and he could think of nothing else: a face in pain, a quiet sunrise, headlights flying over a dirt road. His friends didn't need to know - he had to keep it together.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_95">
		<text>"Major, our new friend is here." Major Czerny stood up as the visitor entered the command room. He got a good, long look at him: behind the slouching demeanor and dirty uniform, he saw the ease of a veteran soldier. The Major offered him a cigarette, which the visitor accepted warily. The Major was in no hurry - Dushman's men were some of their best recruits.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_96">
		<text>The first report came from Pripyat, but most people dismissed it as a rumor. Two days later, the "rumor" wiped out an outpost north of Jupiter. Within a week it had been spotted in the Dark Valley and then in the Great Swamps. A Chimera alright, but it was covered with long, dark hair and roared like rending iron. Everyone was nervous - the Mercs even stopped going out at night.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_97">
		<text>It was the most terrible feeling that I have ever experienced. I sat there in the middle of the Bar, with laughter and drinking all around me, but I couldn't stop thinking about Denis. I left him. I left him to those fucking fanatics. What were they doing to him right now? Was he even alive? I wished I could drink my misery away, but I was sick all the way through.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_98">
		<text>You see that drunk slouched in the corner? He used to be famous around the Zone. He was the best artefact hunter of his time, and everyone wanted to give him work. Then he got jumped by mutants on the way back to camp once, and they chewed up his legs. Now hardly anyone pays attention to him. The Zone can be a funny kind of place, in its own cruel way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_99">
		<text>The search team arrived in the clearing where the screams were heard - it was a horrible mess. The dogs had gotten to him, and there were great smears of blood where the body had been dragged back and forth. They knew the victim was one of their own, but they had to get closer to ID the body. That's when they heard the sound of faint breathing and radioed the news back to Cold.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_100">
		<text>"What were those asswipes thinking? Is this a joke? Hey, I'm talking to you, shithead!" Vector turned from his angry pacing back to the two carriers from Dead City, starting his rant anew. "What were those morons... I can't even go take a shit with this amount of ammo! Hey, Kolin! Looks like we'll be using our shooters as clubs now!"</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_101">
		<text>Silence fell in the camp as everyone turned and saw the lone figure walking slowly between the tents and the campfires, not seeming to take notice of anything. Some men slowly reached for their weapons, but most just stared in amazement. He passed through and out again into the evening mist. By all accounts, it was Dana Viking - killed by bandits a month ago.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_102">
		<text>Fuchs lay between two rusting GAZ trucks, clutching his shoulder and trying to keep quiet. He heard voices all around him, calling out and taunting. Thugs had ambushed him out of nowhere, and he caught a bullet as he was making his escape. Now, he looked at his gun laying on the dead grass and weighed his options. They would find him any minute now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_103">
		<text>Just as I looked up the long, grassy slope, the morning sun swept over the landscape into the forest glen. My feet were sore and my pack was heavy, but I felt happier than I've felt in a long time. Maybe I should just drop the package and turn east until I walked myself right out of the Zone. All your money and all your artefacts can't buy this kind of peace.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_104">
		<text>Our guide turned to us and let out a wry smile. We had paid him an enormous sum of money for a path that he had spent months scouting out alone. You see, we came in from the north - it was the only way to avoid the warzone. We sat down heavily on an old log and beheld the glimmering edifice of the power plant, still a day's hike away.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_105">
		<text>I had my hand on the rusty, old door handle when Vinogradov stopped me. "No, no, no. Like this." He banged his fist on the steel of the door and immediately we heard a chorus of hoarse groans from within. "See?", he said, unpinning a grenade, "You should always knock first."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_106">
		<text>It was night, but the full moon illuminated the grassy plains nearly as well as sunlight. A younger man named Trapper sat next to an older man named Croat. A single, distant howl grew into dozens. "Hear that?", asked Croat. Trapper nodded eagerly. But then there was suddenly just a lone howl, sadder and somehow human. "What was that?", asked the younger. Croat just shook his head. Better not to answer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_107">
		<text>Most people who met Pavlik the Gun didn't forget him - loud, overconfident, and overbearing. He was obsessed with his shooter - he had stuck a bunch of fancy electronics on it and spent his time loading his own match-grade ammunition. He just wouldn't shut up about it. Naturally, he stepped into an electro one day and that was the end of him and his weapon. He'd never even fired the thing outside of target practice.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_108">
		<text>It was a rainy day near Skadovsk, and most people simply stuck around inside. Kind of a drag. Then Andre got that grin he always wears when he decides to start bullshitting. He asks us if we've ever heard of "Void Particles", and then he jumps right into his fairy-tale. Nobody buys it, but we were glad to listen. Everyone needs a good story, especially in the Zone.</text>

		<text>Konstantin was desperately trying to guess how many rounds he had left in the magazine, but he didn't dare take his aim from the doorway. Suddenly, two of his squad-mates ran past him and down the hallway. Before he could decide what to do, an invisible hand seemed to grab onto his rifle and nearly wrenched it out of his hand.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_110">
		<text>Two Soviet soldiers from the border detail sat on some old crates and smoked away. They had a good laugh over the new joke making the rounds: "Shoot any suspicious particles on sight!" Neither of them had a clue why so much security was needed in such a place - obviously, they were being kept in the dark about something. Not to mention all these sinister types walking about in civilian clothing.</text>

		<text>When the U.N. entered the Exclusion Zone, they brought me on as a diplomatic consultant. My business had been to study the various paramilitary groups and criminal organizations around Eastern Europe, but this place was like nowhere else. The situation in the Exclusion Zone had no parallel to anything in the rest of the world. We were completely in the dark.</text>

		<text>That day was when Krylov almost got what was coming to him. We just entered the lab when he started behaving erratically. When he tried putting his gun into his mouth, I figured that he had lied to me about buying the psy-protection. You can't teach some people. So I held him down and didn't stop beating his face until he gave up struggling. He could thank me later.</text>

		<text>Pachowitz was the resident expert on radiation dispersal. He sat in a little cubicle in the UNISG forward headquarters, located around thirty kilometers from the edge of the Zone, and spent most of his time reviewing sensor data and campaigning Field Command to get him more. For him, the Zone was a collection of charts and meteorology reports.</text>

		<text>It was dark and quiet around camp and the first snow of the year was falling. Ignatich made his rounds and stopped to chat with Spore, one of the few still awake. Back outside, he looked up at the white, heavy flakes falling out of the black sky. He coughed as he smoked his cigarette - he was new to smoking. As he looked over to his right, he saw two glowing eyes on the roof of the HQ.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_115">
		<text>They brought in one of our new guys, really just a kid, in on a stretcher. ARS - just riddled with it. He was red like a beet and after he wasn't able to vomit anymore, he just retched with his whole body. I got him on the saline and looked down on this kid, utterly miserable and probably a goner, and I realized that he looked just like my cousin. Exactly like him. It's a waste.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_116">
		<text>A cloud of fear and desperation hung over the man. He showed up in loner settlements to stay the night, and they would find him gone before the sun had risen. He walked with an urgent pace everywhere he went, and an exhausted, dismal look hung in his eyes. He could never feel safe; he knew they were hunting him.</text>

		<text>Before turning in for the night, Bruno jammed up the door and checked his tripwire. Kneeling down over his sleeping bag, Bruno thought back over the events of the day: all of the long miles he had traveled, the people he had seen... and his close brush with death. Bruno had a good aim and a fighting spirit, and he was grateful for it. He softly intoned the well-known words: "Our Father..."</text>

		<text>Sultan's man and the army lieutenant met in the accustomed place at the accustomed time. Time to "pay the toll", as Sultan likes to say.

The buyer leaned forward with interest.</text>

		<text>Vasiliev had just demolished the Q Zone theory and was really heating up. I asked him what he thought of Tellemann's theory. "Inane!", he shouted as we grinned like schoolboys. "Listen, children: Telleman's got his metaphysical axe to grind, and he's convinced that his psuedo-scientific despair is gloriously incarnate in the Zone. Until he presents a cogent argument, he can go to Hell."</text>

		<text>I brandished my knife in front of me while the pack of freaks closed in on all sides. Some were screeching and bellowing - taunting their beaten prey. One tentatively stepped closer and I lunged, screaming and swinging. It pulled back with a sullen look as I whipped around, trying to watch all sides. That's when I heard the crack of bullets and the beasts began to fall.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_122">
		<text>I had rigged a sort of makeshift sling for my broken arm, but it didn't stop pain from shooting all the way up into my spinal cord.

		<text>Muzzle flashes erupted in the early morning mist as the Duty patrol sighted the Freedom outpost. Both sides moved to cover and the fight was destined to be a protracted one.

	<string id="ls_tip_124">
		<text>I took the empty flask from my lips and threw it aside. I looked ahead into the pulsating orbit of humming and hissing anomalies, but my mind was elsewhere. Here I was - doing the only thing I was good at. Honestly, I'd rather it was something less exciting. Damn the alcohol and damn those crooks who sell it to me. I sniffed the air; seemed like a good chance for a Night Star.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_125">
		<text>Dust fell from the rattling rafters as the surge mounted horribly outside. A handful of frightened men huddled up beneath the tin roof and waited helplessly; this was not a tested structure and none of them knew what sort of protection it would offer. Each wave, in blinding orange and purple, seemed to shake the entire building like a ship in a storm.</text>

		<text>He watched carefully, eagerly, from his hiding place, his hungry eyes following every move of the unsuspecting stranger. Suddenly, the same old mistake was made and the stranger was history - his equipment slung everywhere by the force of the anomaly.

		<text>It was nearly dusk when Nimble found himself in the remote little grove where his outside contact had hidden the shipment. The wary stalker had spent the entire day winding this way and that, throwing off potential trackers with false trails and distractions. Some might think this procedure excessive. Nimble didn't. He'd seen enough to know how rarely the Zone forgives mistakes.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_128">
		<text>I could not tell you if it was a dream or not. I was sitting before a calm lake under the brightening grey of a dawn sky and I saw movement out in the middle of the water. I looked and saw the form of a man rise up out of the depths and hold out his hand to me. He said something to me that I understood, but no longer remember. Imperceptibly, he slipped back under the water.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_129">
		<text>They saw each other at the same moment through the screen of leafy bushes. The soldier and the stalker both held rifles, but they had frozen in place. Slowly, the soldier took his left hand from his weapon and raised it. After a moment of silence, the loner simply turned and walked away.</text>

		<text>The was a severe disconnect between the Zone and the external scientific establishment. That would, at least, explain the missive Kruglov was reading.

		<text>After the last shots died away, the Duty soldier walked slowly through the battlefield, both dazed and alert. He approached a corpse riddled with wounds and looked down at it. One of the fanatics. They've been calling them the "dark fanatics" to differentiate them from the "white fanatics". The fight they had put up was shocking. How long could Duty hold back this tide?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_134">
		<text>We already had a wounded man when we left the factory gates and made our way down the ramp. That was when we heard the first crack of hostile fire; we all dove to the ground, desperately hiding ourselves behind sparse grasses. Another crack as a round landed on the slope just beneath us. Flat concrete stretched out around us and we had no idea of the shooter's location.</text>

Opposition was drowned in gunfire.</text>

		<text>The days blurred into one long sequence of careful hikes through the wilderness and uneasy sleep. Igor had always shunned others, and he determined to get to the North his own way. In time, his mind began to lose clarity and he performed his daily activity mechanically. At some point the incremental psy-waves left him brain-dead.</text>

		<text>It was a long time until he stopped screaming, but the hoarse whispering was almost worse. He wanted me to kill him right there, to stop the agony. But I hadn't given up on him yet. I continued to drag him down the long, dusty road. The noontime sun shone on his legs - no more than scorched stumps.</text>

		<text>I saw clearly for the first time: the emissions, the legions of Monolith, the Scorcher, even the nameless things that crawl out of biolabs - all these things radiated outward from the center like a defense mechanism. That just leaves us with the question of what lies in the middle of it all.</text>

		<text>"Why don't we just go that way?" The man pointed down a dark corridor. The leader of the group looked down the passage and said, "We don't go that way. Nobody goes that way. Guys who go that way have a knack of never coming back." The first man persisted. "What's down there, then?"

		<text>We were all sitting around the fire when Leshiy came back. Walking by, he interrupted his stride for a moment to just shake his head before continuing on. He was really gone then - if Leshiy can't find him, no-one can. We looked at his guitar, still sitting in its place by the fire. We would have played something, but the best musician was gone forever.</text>

		<text>The doors of Yanov shut behind me and I flicked the safety off. The air was laden with a heavy, grey fog; everything seemed deadened and unnaturally quiet. I decided to take off my fogging helmet - I was certain something was out there.</text>

		<text>They hadn't beaten him, they hadn't even said a word to him. The spy was taken into some basement and thrown down on the ground. A ring of a dozen men stood around, but one directly in front of him stepped forward. "What you attempted to achieve by deception, you will achieve now in truth. Welcome, brother."

		<text>He thought that he could re-enter the world when he left the Zone. What he found was a brooding sense of apprehension over his entire life. Some fear deep inside him whispered that he had never really left.</text>

		<text>All was tranquil within the ruined room as The Marked One entered. The voice that had been calling seemed to now overwhelm him. "Come to me. I am what you have been seeking. You have wisdom: you know that man's desires are never fulfilled. I am that fulfillment. You will have anything. You will have everything. Come to me to take that which you desire."</text>
